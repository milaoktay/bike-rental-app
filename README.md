## Public Bike Rental Providers

A desktop React application, which shows all local bike rental providers globally on a world map.

### Task

- The page should have an input field
- The page should display a `Map` with `Markers` for each bike rental provider
- The map should contain a `ZoomControl`.
- The page should list all bike rental providers below the `Map`.
- While the user tips, the app should update the markers on the map and the bike rental provider list.
- When the user clicks on a `Marker`, additional information about the provider should be displayed.
- Use Geolocation to center the map around user's current location as default.
